## Running your React Native application

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to
the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo
Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.
On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera
app.

## Running your app on a simulator or virtual device

Expo Go allows you to run your React Native app on a physical device
without installing iOS and Android native SDKs. If you want to run
your app on the iOS Simulator or an Android Virtual Device, please
refer to the instructions for "React Native CLI Quickstart" to learn
how to install Xcode or set up your Android development environment.

If you're on NixOS, following works:

```
nix develop
npx expo start
# then start android emulator
```
